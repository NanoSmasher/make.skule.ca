This session uses the concepts learnt in both CIV100 and CIV102 to explain how internal forces behave in structures. Using a method called ‘tensional integrity’, or ‘tensegrity’ for short, we will construct a variety of structures, which provide their own internal forces in order to become much stronger, and even self-equilibrating. This knowledge applies very strongly to the concepts taught in first year, as well as those required throughout other disciplines and in future years. Real life applications include both tensegrity structures and Robotics.
