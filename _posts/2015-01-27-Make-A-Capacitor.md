Electric fields are at the heart of electrical engineering, circuitry, and modern life itself. In this session, students will get the opportunity to learn about the electric field and how to use it, apply their knowledge by building a capacitor and optimizing the capacitance, see how a dielectric affects capacitance, and learn about how this is used in the oil industry.
