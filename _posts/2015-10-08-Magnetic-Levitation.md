Students will build a device to levitate a small magnet using diamagnetically stabilized levitation. Students will learn the principles behind permanent magnets and the magnetic properties of materials, as well as how it relates to electromagnetism. By using diamagnetism, it is possible to work around Earnshaw's theorem and levitate a magnet with no external energy supply or physical contact.
