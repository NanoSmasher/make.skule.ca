This sessions explores the concepts of PID Controller and how it is used to navigate Differential Drive Robots. We will learn to derive the Kinematics of a Differential Drive Robot using knowledge from MAT188 & MAT194/MAT196 to program parts of a simple robotic simulator. This knowledge applies very strongly to concepts taught in first year Calculus and Linear Algebra. Programming will be done in Matlab with no prior experience programming in Matlab required.
