Explore the bizarre properties of the gyroscope. Its non-intuitive reaction to external forces can be explained through the physics of angular momentum. Observe the effects of rotational motion and angular momentum and explain the theory behind it by experimenting and building gyroscopes. Gyroscopes have applications in mobile devices, space navigation, camera and drone stabilization.
