This session investigates the Stirling Engine and associated thermodynamic cycle. By making suitable simplifications, we will see how a complex topic can be understood using the concepts taught in first year courses (i.e. CHE112/APS104/MSE160). Furthermore, the participant's mechanical intuition and craftsmanship will be called upon as they try to assemble and tune a design for a Stirling Engine. Insight is given into the design process; for instance, Design for Assembly.
